Magma Maze 

All sound effects from freesound.com
Tiles, magma ball and enemies created on canva.com (by me)
Player animation created from LPC Character generator 

The game I created for my project is called Magma Maze.
Magma maze contains sprites such as character animation, tile maps, shooting, and key presses. 
The goal of the gme is to clear the map from the lava and dodge the magma monsters. 
You cna chnage between the tile by clicking on them.
Depending which tile you land on it will increase or decrease the character's speed
I have incorporated SFX's for shooting and collisions.
My file for the background music is big for my repository so here's the link:
